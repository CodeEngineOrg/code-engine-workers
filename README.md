This library is used inside [CodeEngine](https://engine.codes/) to provide multi-threaded concurrency. It exports a `WorkerPool` class, which manages worker threads and uses them to process files.

> **NOTE:** This is an **internal library** that is only intended to be used by CodeEngine. Using it outside of CodeEngine is discouraged.



`WorkerPool` class
-------------------------------
This class creates worker threads, manages their lifecycle, and transfers CodeEngine files back and forth between threads for processing.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";

// Create a new WorkerPool instance
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);

try {
  // Import a FileProcessor plugin in all workers
  let processFile = await pool.importFileProcessor("./my-file-processor.js");

  // Process a file on one of the workers
  await processFile(myFile, run);
}
finally {
  // Safely dispose the pool and threads
  await pool.dispose();
}
```


### `WorkerPool` constructor
The constructor accepts a [`CodeEngine` object](https://github.com/CodeEngineOrg/code-engine-types/blob/master/src/code-engine.d.ts).

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";
import CodeEngine from "code-engine";

let engine = new CodeEngine();
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);
```


### `WorkerPool.size`
Read-only property that returns the number of worker threads in the pool. After the [`dispose()` method](#workerpooldispose) is called, this property will always return zero.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";
import CodeEngine from "code-engine";

let engine = new CodeEngine({ concurrency: 4 });
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);
console.log(pool.size);   // 4

await pool.dispose();
console.log(pool.size);   // 0
```


### `WorkerPool.isDisposed`
Indicates whether the [`dispose()` method](#workerpooldispose) has been called. Once disposed, the `WorkerPool` instance is no longer usable.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";

let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);
console.log(engine.isDisposed);     // false

await engine.dispose();
console.log(engine.isDisposed);     // true
```


### `WorkerPool.importFileProcessor(moduleId, [data])`
Imports a CodeEngine [`FileProcessor` plugin](https://github.com/CodeEngineOrg/code-engine-types#types) in all worker threads.

- **moduleId:** The module name or path. The module must export a [`FileProcessor`](https://github.com/CodeEngineOrg/code-engine-types#types) function.

- **data:** (optional) Data to pass to the module. This is only relevant if the module's default export is a function accepts this data and returns a [`FileProcessor`](https://github.com/CodeEngineOrg/code-engine-types#types) function.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);

// Import a FileProcessor plugin in all workers
let processFile = await pool.importFileProcessor("./my-file-processor.js");

// Process a file on one of the workers
await processFile(myFile, run);
```


### `WorkerPool.importModule(moduleId, [data])`
Imports a JavaScript module in all worker threads. The module export (if any) is ignored. This method is intended for loading polyfills, globals, hooks, and other modules with side-effects.

- **moduleId:** The module name or path

- **data:** (optional) Data to pass to the module. This is only relevant if the module's default export is a function that accepts this data.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);

// Import a polyfill module in all worker threads
await pool.importModule("@babel/polyfill");
```


### `WorkerPool.dispose()`
Terminates the worker threads and releases all system resources that are held by a `WorkerPool` instance. Once `dispose()` is called, the WorkerPool instance is no longer usable.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";

let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);
await pool.dispose();
```


### "error" event
This event is fired whenever an unhandled error occurs in any of the worker threads. If you don't handle this event, then Node.js will automatically terminate the process.

> **NOTE:** When an unhandled error occurs, the `WorkerPool` instance and/or its worker threads may be left in an invalid or unusable state. For this reason, we recommend that you [dispose the `WorkerPool` instance](#workerpooldispose) and stop using it.

```javascript
import WorkerPool from "@code-engine/workers";
let pool = new WorkerPool(engine);

pool.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error("An unhandled error occurred:", error);
  pool.dispose();
});
```
